With Devapt you can easily develop powerfull application.

Devapt libraries are usefull to quickly develop applications with more JSON configuration and less code.


## What is Devapt ?

The Developpers Application Toolkit (Devapt) is a usefull package for developers:
create quickly and securely a complex distributed set of applications or a simple alone application into one or more nodejs.

This project is based on Javascript (ECMAscript 6 transpiled in ES5) and nodejs.
Devapt contains a server runtime and a set of client features.
Devapt help you to write less code and to use easily more features.

The principle is simple: you write some configuration files for distributed nodes, models, views and menus and the you start the application.
The framework will automatically generates the server and manages common features (logges, traces, metrics, restful, security...).
Simply launch index.html and your application is up a rich user interface and many features.

Built-in features cover many important subjects as: authentication, restfull, http server, distributed services, logs, metrics...
Main characteristics of DEVAPT architecture is dynamic behaviors, reactive programming, object oriented ES6 javascript, gulp build chain
All of this on NodeJS.

My main initial purpose was to provide me a simple way to play with new scientifical or computer concepts by writing some labs applications.
